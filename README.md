Questions to answer:
1.	My research is on soil health management in hop yards dealing with cover cropping practices. We are interested in finding out what impact long term (10+ years) cover cropping practices in Yakima, WA have on hop yards in comparison to short term (about 1-2 years) cover cropping practices in the Willamette Valley, OR. There are around ten soil health metrics we will be evaluating such as pH, aggregate stability, and carbon and nitrogen values. Additionally, we will collect information from the growers about their field site, management practices, and crop history. Based on the values we produce, we aim to inform hop growers about the practices we find to be associated with better soil health. 
2.	The data that we will be using to answer our research questions are all non-human subject data, mostly numerical results, some observational data, with most data produced from experimental procedures. In addition, we are also collecting character or text data such as soil texture classes (silt loam) or information about the management practices growers use for tillage, nutrient applications, etc. There are around 10 soil health metric data sets, along with several routine questions for growers about the hop yards. Most of the data below are collected through our protocols with our most used instruments are a centrifuge, an incubator, drying ovens, and scales for weight measurements. We do have other more advanced machinery to collect greenhouse gas emissions from microbial respiration and a soil texture machine that analyzes particle size.
The soil health metrics we are collecting:
1.	pH
2.	Texture
3.	Microbial respiration/water holding capacity
4.	Aggregate stability
5.	Bulk density
6.	POM, MAOM
7.	Carbon/nitrogen 
8.	DNA
9.	Enzyme activity (2 tests)
10.	TBD mint incubation (in initial discussion phase still)
3.	The amount of data generated is somewhat unknown but less than 1 GB. Each soil health metric as listed above produces around 1000 KB, by ten different variables, over a period of 2 years of collection, in addition to grower metadata questions, roughly equals a total of 500 MB I would guess.
