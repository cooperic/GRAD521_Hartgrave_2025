# GRAD521_Hartgrave_2025

This is a data managment plan for GRAD521.

## Research context
My research project is primarily on soil health in hop yards. The soil health metrics of hop yards are different between the yards that have a history (10+ years) of cover cropping and yards that have recently (1-2 years) added cover cropping to their field management plans. Soil health metrics will be evaluated and compared between field locations to then inform the growers about our findings. My project will also explore the impact of different compost types in mint fields and hop yards.


## About author
I am a soil science master's student at Oregon State University. I got my bachelor's degree in Crop and Soil science, with a focus in plant breeding and genetics, and a soil science minor. I am hoping to get into the nursery business when I graduate and continue to conduct research with plants and the soil.
