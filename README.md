# GRAD521_Hartgrave_2025

This is data managment plan for GRAD521.

## Research context
My research project is on soils in hop yards. The soil health metrics of hop yards are different between yards that have a history (10+ years) of cover cropping and yards that have recently (1-2 years) added cover cropping in their field management plans. These soil health metrics will be evaluated and compared between field locations to then inform the growers about our findings.
